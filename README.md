# Open Voxel
Open Voxel is an open-source game that is *like* Minecraft, but only in the sense that the world is composed of 1 meter squared cubes. We'll refer to these as "Megavoxels". Engines like the ones used in Teardown are actual voxels, which only really store color information, and maybe some extra variables like toughness or roughness. Our Megavoxels can have associated state (Tile Entities), event handlers, and can even have different appearances based on the blocks around them (Connectivity).

Open Voxel aims to have its own identity separate from Minecraft. I am not "recreating" Minecraft. I am building on the foundation left by Minecraft, but only in the sense that the world is composed of 1x1x1 voxels.

## Goals
> The goal is not to create the best painting, it is to provide a _canvas_ that people _want_ to paint.

No matter _who_ or _where_ you are, some version of Open Voxel will be available to you, for free, so long as you have a supported device and an internet connection. That free version may not be the most recent version, but it **will be free**. I want Open Voxel to be a way for people from all over the world to connect in a creative medium. I do not want people to be unable to experience the game because of their economic situation, geographics location, or physical disabilities. If there are ways I could make the experience more accessible, please feel free to post in the Discord.

## Monetization
The cost of OpenVoxel on most platforms will be somewhere in the range of 5$ to 10$ per yer, per account. A subscription model like this is ultimately **much better** than a 1-time cost because it will allow us to cater to the existing playerbase instead of new players. Minecraft, for example, has to cater to kids because its monetization strategy is based purely on growth. Trackmania on the other hand can cater to its existing _very dedicated_ playerbase because they have a subscription model. The subscription will include the latest version of the game, access to pre-releases (PC version only), and server hosting. 

As mentioned in the Goals section, the PC/Web version will have a free mode that is always a few versions behind. This way, even those who are economically disadvantaged can enjoy the game - if not with the latest features.
